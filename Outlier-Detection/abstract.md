We implement and compare novel outlier detection methods to remove outliers and see how they affect causal impact estimates. This study evaluates these modelsâ€™ accuracy in outlier detection and their impact on treatment effect estimation with simulated and real-world data. We highlight outlier solutions that minimize removing observations, while also preserving accuracy in causal impact analysis. Specifically, we find that ensembles of outlier detection methods are the most effective at obtaining accurate treatment effect estimates, while also minimizing the removal of observations in high-dimensional data.<img width="468" height="101" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29a4429d-e95d-4940-836c-520f20d7bfb8" />
